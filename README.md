## Day 5 – Backup and Continuity

### Scenario:
As construction delays pushed us back to Chicago temporarily, I needed to ensure the current system setup could be restored once we return to Arlington Heights.

### Tech Explanation:
I created a snapshot of the Domain Controller VM, capturing the system’s current state, ensuring seamless recovery of user data, policies, and configurations when we’re back in Arlington. (Got guidance from ChatGPT on proper snapshot usage and backup strategies.)
