## Day 5 – Backup and Continuity

### Scenario:
As construction delays pushed us back to Chicago temporarily, I needed to ensure the current system setup could be restored once we return to Arlington Heights.

### Tech Explanation:
I created a snapshot of the Domain Controller VM, capturing the system’s current state, ensuring seamless recovery of user data, policies, and configurations when we’re back in Arlington. (Got guidance from ChatGPT on proper snapshot usage and backup strategies.)

### ✅ Conclusion – Jose’s Role in a Real-World Scenario
This five-day Active Directory lab wasn’t just a technical checklist—it became a dynamic case study for what real IT professionals face: provisioning new infrastructure, managing users, securing sensitive data, and preparing for disaster recovery.

I used this lab to solidify my Azure and AD skills, build a deployment story I could confidently walk through in an interview, and sharpen my troubleshooting instincts. Tools like ChatGPT were essential in helping me think through real-world context, confirm steps, and make this more than just a lab—it became a professional simulation.
